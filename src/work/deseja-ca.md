"University extension, under the constitutional principle of the inseparability between teaching, research and extension, is an interdisciplinary educational, cultural, scientific and political process which promotes the transforming interaction between universities and other sectors of society" (PRoEx - UFMG)

Sustainable Development and Social Enterprise Program in Jardim Canadá was founded by a partnership between The Federal University of Minas Gerais – UFMG and the Art & Technology Center of Jardim Canadá – JA.CA. Jardim Canadá is located in the suburbs of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, that has a continuous increase in industrial growth and, on the other hand, a disadvantaged population that lacks skilled labor. The overall objective of the Program DESEJA.CA, and all extension projects linked to this, is to act with the local development of this neighborhood.

With that, as from urban and architectural interventions create a core of collective creation integrating design, architecture and craft always exploring the use of recycled material and the recognition of local popular knowledge. The program's actions include research groups, extension projects, cultural and social events, partnerships with local businesses, universities and other government institutions.

It is expected the products to be sold in upscale markets, due to the value-added design, and simultaneously be part of interventions in public spaces and housing sites. Promoting a new language that enhances the product and is inserted in the local identity, creating products with strong characteristics of the place and the community involved.
