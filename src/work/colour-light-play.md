Interactive colour projection installation in Haus am Horn , UNESCO World Heritage Bauhaus part of the project "Bauhaus Experiment - between Architecture and Media" focused on experiments with natural and artificial light. The projection is controlled by a digital interface (iPad) where the visitor can choose between categories. That combined with analogue interface coloured cubes, based on the original furniture of the children’s room of Haus am Horn, and glasses with coloured filters provides other effects through colour overlapping (e.g. Subtractive colour mix). This way the exhibition is designed to different groups of users.
