The project Video Mapping Experiments consists of video mapping animations to be projected at the Haus am Horn, the famous experimental building project of the Weimar Bauhaus (UNESCO World Heritage). In the first part of the project, the group built a physical model of the Haus am Horn on the scale 1:20 as precise as possible to avoid problems when projecting on the real surface of the house. The bigger it is the dimension of the model the better it is to visualise the projection. The material used was MDF wood finished with white spray paint and acrylic glass for the windows.

The second part was about developing individual ideas for animations through a storyboard relating to Bauhaus history and the house itself. With the storyboard and the technological background it was possible to create the animations making use of softwares for modelling, motion graphics and video editing.

The idea of this animation is to bring out the interior of the house in different ways, analysing the structure, the sun and shadow contrast and also playing with colours, the same that Walter Gropius used in a drawing from 1923, and give it movement as a spatial puzzle.
