The film FROM HOLLYWOOD TO WASHING MASHINES - Hans Sigmund Jaretzki’s Park Lichtspiele Cinema in Berlin was shown in a series of group-exhibitions of the Centre for Documentary Architecture (CDA), Bauhaus-University Weimar at the annual exhibition of the Bauhaus-Universität in 2014, where it also won the Bauhaus Essentials Prize. In 2015 we were invited to present this work in Tel Aviv as part of the Open House event of the Architecture Research Centre White City Tel Aviv which was inaugurated by the German Minister Barbara Hendricks.

The exhibition was organized by the students based on their works on "Forgotten Architecture" with an interdisciplinary display that employed different types of media, including films, blueprints, literature and digital technologies, which depict various buildings that were designed by emigrant architects.
