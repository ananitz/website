The project for the CCAC – Convention Center: Art & Culture is inserted on the urban environment adjacent to the hotel Golden Tulip, a large investment in the region of hypercenter, designed to meet the demands of business tourism in Belo Horizonte. Having in mind that the city would have been one of the venues of the World Cup in 2014 and with that, more interventions would come through urban operations and the instruments of urban planning should be focused on benefiting areas of the city with lack of infrastructure. This way the CCAC aims to create public and common spaces with high quality so that citizens can also make use of the new scenario that will arise from such interventions.
