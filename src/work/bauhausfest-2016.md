Short film made in collaboration with the architect Stefanie Holzheu and the artists of the Kybernetischer Zirkus to be projected onto the facade of the original building of the Bauhaus Dessau during the nights of the event Bauhausfest 2016. The idea was to reveal some details of the circus performance and elements of the architectural landscape, created after a print by Moholy-Nagy, where the show took place during the event.
